git tag -a v0.3.0 -m "Release v0.3.0 - Production Ready"
git push origin v0.3.0
```

**What happens automatically:**
1. ✅ Release workflow runs
2. ✅ Package is built and tested
3. ✅ GitHub Release is created
4. ✅ Release notes are generated
5. ✅ Distribution files are attached
6. ✅ (Optional) Published to PyPI if token is set

### Method 2: Manual Workflow Dispatch

1. Go to: https://github.com/he2plus/he2plus-lib/actions
2. Click "Release" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Enter version: `0.3.0`
5. Click "Run workflow"

### Method 3: GitHub Web Interface

   - **Environment**: `pypi`

### Option 2: API Token

1. Go to https://pypi.org/manage/account/token/

## 🎯 Post-Push Actions

### 1. Verify Workflows Pass

After pushing, check:
```
https://github.com/he2plus/he2plus-lib/actions
```

Expected results:
- ✅ Tests pass on all Python versions
- ✅ Build succeeds
- ✅ Lint checks pass
- ✅ Status check passes

### 2. Create Release

Once workflows pass:
```bash
git tag -a v0.3.0 -m "Release v0.3.0 - Production Ready"
git push origin v0.3.0
```

### 3. Verify Release

Check:
```
https://github.com/he2plus/he2plus-lib/releases
```

Should see:
- ✅ Release v0.3.0 created
- ✅ Release notes generated
- ✅ .whl and .tar.gz files attached

### 4. Test Installation

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/he2plus/he2plus-lib.git@v0.3.0
he2plus --version
he2plus list --available
```

### 5. (Optional) Publish to PyPI

If PyPI is set up:
- Release workflow will auto-publish
- Or manually: `gh workflow run publish.yml`

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Workflow Fails

**Check**:
1. View workflow run on GitHub Actions
2. Check error messages
3. Verify Python version compatibility
4. Check dependencies in requirements.txt

**Common Issues**:
- Missing dependencies: Add to requirements.txt
- Python version: Check pyproject.toml
- Import errors: Check __init__.py files
- Test failures: Check test files exist

### Release Fails

**Check**:
1. Tag format: Must be `v*` (e.g., `v0.3.0`)
2. Permission: Need write access to repository
3. Build: Package must build successfully
4. Tests: All tests must pass

### PyPI Publishing Fails

**Check**:
1. PyPI token is set in GitHub secrets
2. Version number not already published
3. Package name available on PyPI
4. Trusted publishing configured (if using)
